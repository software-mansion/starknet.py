Data transformation
-------------------

Starknet.py transforms python values to Cairo values and the other way around.

   * - Expected Cairo type
     - Accepted python types
     - Example python values
     - Comment
   * - felt
     - int, string (at most 31 characters)
     - ``0``, ``1``, ``1213124124``, 'shortstring', ''
     - Provided int must be in range [0;P) - P being the Prime used in cairo-vm.
       Can also be provided a short 31 character string, which will get
       translated into felt with first letter as MSB of the felt
   * - tuple
     - any iterable of matching size
     - ``(1, 2, (9, 8))``, ``[1, 2, (9, 8)]``, ``(v for v in [1, 2, (9, 8)])``
     - Can nest other types apart from pointers
   * - named tuple
     - dict or NamedTuple
     - ``{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c" : (3, 4)}``, ``NamedTuple("name", [("a", int), ("b", int), ("c", tuple)])(1, 2, (3, 4))``
     -
   * - struct
     - dict with keys matching struct
     - ``{"key_1": 2, "key_2": (1, 2, 3), "key_3": {"other_struct_key": 13}}``
     - Can nest other types apart from pointers
   * - pointer to felt/felt arrays (requires additional ``parameter_len`` parameter)
     - any iterable containing ints
     - ``[1, 2, 3]``, ``[]``, ``(1, 2, 3)``
     - ``parameter_len`` is filled automatically from value
   * - pointer to struct/struct arrays (requires additional ``parameter_len`` parameter)
     - any iterable containing dicts
     - ``[{"key": 1}, {"key": 2}, {"key": 3}]``, ``[]``, ``({"key": 1}, {"key": 2}, {"key": 3})``
     - ``parameter_len`` is filled automatically from value
   * - uint256
     - int or dict with ``"low"`` and ``"high"`` keys and ints as values
     - ``0``, ``340282366920938463463374607431768211583``, ``{"low": 12, "high": 13}``

Working with shortstrings
-------------------------

To make working with short strings easier we provide some utility functions to translate the felt value received from the contract, into a short string value. A function which translates a string into a felt is also available, but the transformation is done automatically when calling the contract with shortstring in place of felt - they are interchangeable.
You can read more about how cairo treats shortstrings in `the documentation <https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/consts.html#short-string-literals>`_.

Conversion functions and references:

- :obj:`encode_shortstring <starknet_py.cairo.felt.encode_shortstring>`
- :obj:`decode_shortstring <starknet_py.cairo.felt.decode_shortstring>`

Parsing emitted events
----------------------

CairoSerializer can be used to transform data between cairo and python format.
It requires an abi of the contract, types of values and data to be serialized.

In particular, it can be used to parse an event emitted by a transaction to python usable format.
